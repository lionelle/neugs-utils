Welcome to Gradescope's Documentation!
======================================
Welcome to the Northeastern University Gradescope Utility project, used for alternative grading schemes, 
including mastery grading and standards grading.

Features
=====================================

Tier Mastery Grading:
--------------------------

Focuses on mastery based grading in grading tiers, meaning grades are corrected, so only the tests are passed in order based on groups. If any test in a group stops, so does all grading until the previous group is fixed.

Common tiers are *(COMMON_ONE, COMMON_TWO, COMMON_THREE, COMMON_FOUR)* which is "Learning", "Approaching", "Meets", "Exceeds". To tag a test in a tier use the tier decorator. An example of a common test setup with tier grading would be as follows

**Example:**

.. code-block:: python
      
   from gradescope_utils.autograder_utils.decorators import number, tags
   from neugs_utils import tier, COMMON_ONE, COMMON_TWO, COMMON_THREE

   class TestOne(unittest.TestCase):
      @tier(COMMON_THREE)
      @tags("Learning")  #tags should come *after* tiers if they are used at all
      @number(3.0)
      def test_random(self):
            result = 6
            for i in (6, 5, 61):
               self.assertEqual(result, i, "this is my message, that display due to TWO failing")

      @tier(COMMON_TWO)
      @number(2.0)
      def test_approaching(self):
            result = 3
            self.assertEqual(result, 5, "this should fail")

      @tier(COMMON_TWO)
      @number(2.0)
      def test_some_other_approaching(self):
            result = 5
            self.assertEqual(result, 5, "this should pass")

      @tier(COMMON_ONE)
      @number(1.0)
      def test_valid(self):
            self.assertEqual(5, 5, "really!")

      @tier(COMMON_ONE)
      @number(1.1)
      def test_valid2(self):
            self.assertEqual(6, 6, "really!")

Given the example above, and assuming default points of 1 point per tier, the above student would earn 1 point, and will be encouraged to submit again to completed Tier Two and Tier 3

In run_test.py make sure to change JSONTestRunner to TierMasteryJSONTestRunner

   

.. code-block:: python

   import unittest
   from neugs_utils import TierMasteryJSONTestRunner


   if __name__ == '__main__':
      suite = unittest.defaultTestLoader.discover('tests')
      with open('/autograder/results/results.json', 'w') as f:
         TierMasteryJSONTestRunner(visibility='visible', stream=f).run(suite)




Utilities:
--------------------------

There are also a number of additional utility functions added in common_tests.py and context_managers.py. These are meant to be for utility to help with common grading tasks.

This module is still in early stages of development!
